# Giftastic


This was a project to consume GIPHY API to be able to pull gifs from using an API call for predefined searchwords as well as custom searchwords. Theme used was animals and rating of gifs was PG-13 or G.

An API key was passed along with the searchword in the API call request and the gifs availale in the response on a successful request were populated on the page. Anr input box was  available on the page to add new custom searchterm for getting new Gifs.
